House Price Prediction Project
Overview

This project is focused on analyzing a dataset of house sales to predict house prices based on various features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and other attributes. The goal is to understand the relationships between these variables and use them to predict house prices more accurately.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project, kc_house_data.csv, contains detailed information about houses, including:

price: Price of the house.

bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house.

bathrooms: Number of bathrooms.

sqft_living: Living area in square feet.

sqft_lot: Lot size in square feet.

floors: Number of floors.

waterfront: Whether the house has a waterfront view (1 for yes, 0 for no).

view: The quality of the view (0 to 4 scale).

condition: Condition of the house.

grade: Overall grade given to the house based on its construction and design.

sqft_above: Square footage of the house above ground.

sqft_basement: Square footage of the basement.

yr_built: Year the house was built.

zipcode: Zipcode where the house is located.

lat: Latitude of the house.

Analyze relationships between variables:

Use correlation matrix to find relationships between features.

Train machine learning models (such as linear regression, decision trees) to predict house prices.

Visualize the data using various plots (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts).

long: Longitude of the house.

sqft_living15: Living area of the 15 nearest neighbors.

sqft_lot15: Lot size of the 15 nearest neighbors.
